Step 2: Configure the Catalog Item Variable

  Case 1: Using Predefined Choices
    1.	Go to your catalog item and create a new variable.
    2.	Select Select Box as the variable type.  
    3.	At the bottom, create your predefined choices.
    4.	After creating the choices, change the variable type from Select Box to Custom.
    5.	Provide the widget name in the Type specifications.

Case 2: Using Scripts to Fetch Choices Dynamically
    1.	Create a Custom variable and link it to the widget. No question choices are needed.
    2.	Create a new variable of type Single Line Text.
    3.	Name this variable the same as the first variable, but add hidden_ at the beginning.
        -	This ensures the logic associates this variable with the first one.
    4.	In the hidden variable, provide a script in the Default Value field.
        -	Example: Call a Script Include that returns filtered options (e.g., filtered licenses).
