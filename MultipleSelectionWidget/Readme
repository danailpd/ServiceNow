Step 2: Configure the Catalog Item Variable

  Case 1: Using Predefined Choices
    1.	Go to your catalog item and create a new variable.
    2.	Pick "Select Box" as the variable type.  
    3.	At the bottom, create your predefined choices.
    4.	After creating the choices, change the variable type from "Select Box" to "Custom" or "Custom with Label".
    5.	Provide the widget name in the Type specifications.

Case 2: Using Scripts to Fetch Choices Dynamically
    1.	Create a variable with type "Custom" or "Custom with Label".
    2.	Provide the widget name in the Type specifications.
    3.	Create a new variable of type Single Line Text.
    4.	Name this variable the same as the first variable, but add hidden_ at the beginning.
        •	This ensures the logic associates this variable with the first one.
    5.	In the hidden variable, provide a script in the Default Value field, which needs to return array of objects containing label and value.
        •	Example: Call a Script Include that returns filtered options (e.g., filtered licenses). [{label: "TestLabel", value: "test_value"}]
